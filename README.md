# Martin Kubovčík 🇸🇰💻🤖

👋🏼 Welcome to my personal profile. Here I post my projects about machine learning and robotics. I'm interested in developing agents that play games or I'd like making robots that perform any tasks. I'm using primary Python and C/C++ languages because I work with many performance required applications. I have experiences with Tensorflow 2 & Keras, OpenAI Gym, wanDB, Arduino IDE, Raspberry Pi and so on.
