# Martin Kubovčík

👋🏼 Welcome to my personal profile. Here I post my projects about machine learning and robotics. I'm interested in developing agents that play games or I'd like making robots that perform any tasks. I'm using primary Python, C/C++ and Julia languages. I have experiences with Tensorflow 2 & Keras, OpenAI Gym, Gymnasium, WanDB, Arduino IDE, Raspberry Pi and so on.
