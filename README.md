🔭 **I’m currently working on**  
Reinforcement Learning frameworks for robotics, Transformer-based models for time-series forecasting, and fun game environments for RL experiments

👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on**  
Reinforcement Learning projects • Robotics with RL • Game AI agents • Transformer applications in real-world problems (HAR, forecasting, etc.)

🤝 **I’m looking for help with**  
Scaling RL experiments to real robotic hardware • Optimizing Transformer models for edge devices • Creating more complex Gymnasium environments

🌱 **I’m currently learning**  
Advanced robotics control with RL • Latest developments in foundation models for sequential decision making • Julia for high-performance scientific computing

💬 **Ask me about**  
Gymnasium environments, Transformers for Human Activity Recognition, Solar Irradiance forecasting, Flappy Bird RL agents, Arduino + Raspberry Pi + ML projects

⚡ **Fun fact**  
I created one of the most popular open-source Flappy Bird Gymnasium environments — and yes, I’ve trained agents that are way better at it than I am! 🐦🎮
