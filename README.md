# Bc. Martin Kubovčík 🇸🇰💻🤖

👋🏼 Welcome to my personal profile. Here I post my projects about machine learning and robotics. I'm interested in developing agents that play games or I'd like making robots that perform any tasks. I'm using primary Python and C/C++ languages because I work with many performance required applications. I have experiences with Tensorflow 2 & Keras, OpenAI Gym, wanDB, Arduino IDE, Raspberry Pi and so on.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [RL-Toolkit](https://github.com/markub3327/rl-toolkit) and [AIGarden](https://github.com/markub3327/AIGarden).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Django, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
- 💬 Ask me about anything you want of my projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: markub3327@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like gardening 🌹 and astronomy 🔭.
